# clinic-database-using-sqlite-and-tkinter

Hello, this project is a clinic database system that I wrote using the sqlite library in Python. I wrote this project for a database course in university, so it has a very simple graphical interface.
There are also various sql commands in this project to extract data from the database.
To use this project, it is necessary to fill your database with the required information so that select commands and other sql commands can be done well.
In addition, the tkinter library is used for the graphic interface.
To view the tables related to the database, use the DB browser for sqlite software. Finally, I would like to point out that the buttons of this software are written in Farsi language, and if needed, you can translate and replace them in the language you need.
good luck
